### **Executive Summary:**

This project applies machine learning models to predict **hotel booking cancellations**, helping hotels optimize revenue, manage overbookings, and enhance customer retention strategies. The final model, **Random Forest Classifier**, achieved **89.1% accuracy and an F1-score of 85.4%**, making it the most effective solution for deployment. The insights generated from this model not only benefit hotel operations but also provide **risk assessment strategies for the finance and insurance industries**, particularly in revenue forecasting and loss mitigation.  


### **Problem Statement**  
Hotel booking cancellations present a **significant financial challenge**,40% of the customers who booked cancelled, leading to **revenue loss, inaccurate demand forecasting, and operational inefficiencies**. Understanding the factors behind cancellations enables hotels to:  
- Reduce financial losses from last-minute cancellations.  
- Adjust overbooking strategies to ensure optimal occupancy.  
- Improve customer segmentation and targeted promotions.  
- Support risk evaluation for travel insurance providers and financial institutions.  

Our Machine learning driven methodology approach provides a data-driven approach to predict cancellations, allowing businesses to take proactive measures.


### **Solution Approach**  
This project builds a predictive model using structured hotel booking data to classify whether a booking will be canceled. The methodology follows:  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover key cancellation patterns and trends.  
2. **Feature Engineering** to enhance predictive accuracy, including lead time transformation, deposit type flags, and high-risk customer segmentation.  
3. **Model Selection & Training** by testing Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.   
4. **Feature Importance Analysis** to identify the strongest predictors of cancellations.  
5. **Business Recommendations** to implement predictive insights for reducing cancellations.

**Best Model for Deployment:** Random Forest Classifier
- Highest accuracy and F1-score, balancing precision and recall.  
- Better handling of feature interactions, outperforming simpler models.  
- Provides explainability through feature importance analysis.  



### **Feature Importance & Business Insights**
The **most influential features driving cancellations** were:  
1. Lead Tim: Longer lead times increase cancellation likelihood.  
2. Non-Refundable Deposits: Drastically reduce cancellations.  
3. Country of Origin (Portugal, Germany, Turkey): Customers from certain regions cancel more often.  
4. Special Requests: Guests with more requests cancel less.  
5. Pricing (ADR - Average Daily Rate): Higher prices increase cancellation probability.  
6. Booking Channel (OTAs vs. Direct Bookings): OTA-based bookings cancel more.  
7. Customer Type: Transient customers have the highest cancellation rates.  

These insights can help hotels implement targeted cancellation mitigation strategies, such as:  
- Stricter cancellation policies for high-risk bookings.
- Offering prepaid discounts to encourage non-refundable reservations.
- Adjusting pricing models and promotions based on cancellation risk.



### **Impact Beyond Hospitality: Finance & Insurance Industry Applications**  
Beyond hotel operations, this model provides **valuable risk assessment tools** for the **finance and insurance industries**, including:  
- **Revenue Forecasting**: Financial analysts can **predict cash flow fluctuations** based on expected cancellations.  
- **Loan Risk Evaluation**: Hotels seeking financing can use cancellation forecasts to demonstrate stable revenue streams.  
- **Travel Insurance Risk Assessment**: Insurers can adjust premiums for policies covering hotel cancellations based on model predictions.  
- **Dynamic Pricing in Financial Markets**: Similar methodologies can be applied to predict demand in financial assets and travel booking platforms.  

This highlights the broader commercial value of machine learning-driven demand forecasting.


### **Final Recommendations**
1. Deploy the Random Forest model** to predict and mitigate cancellations.  
2. Implement proactive booking policies** based on risk segmentation.  
3. Leverage model insights to optimize revenue management strategies.
4. Apply cancellation prediction models to the finance and insurance sectors.

This project demonstrates how **AI-driven demand forecasting** can improve operational efficiency, revenue management, and risk assessment, creating significant value for **hotels, financial institutions, and insurers** alike.
